# Fantasy-Basketball
Effectively this is single metric fantasy sports with a twist. 

The business flow:
Each player created their fantasy team of NBA shooters.  At the end of the team, whichever team hits the most 3 point shots wins.  No lineups to set, no waiver wire to work, just pick one group before the season and you get them for the season.  

You must separate the players into 5 divisions based on their tier. 
Top 15 in three point makes per game in tier 1
16-30 in tier 2
31-45 in tier 3
46-60 in tier 4
61-75 in tier 5 
(we can maybe manually put players in tiers later if we want to avoid weird loop holes)

Each team selects 3 players in each tier for the whole season.  You have to factor in expected health and improvement / regression from previous season to pick the best team possible.

End of the basketball year, team with the most 3s wins the league.
